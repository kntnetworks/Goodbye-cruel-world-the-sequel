# Goodbye-cruel-world-the-sequel
My first git hub project thingy - the sequel cuz i forgot to initialize with a README

A little about me:
I already had to re-do my first project because I forgot to click the thing.  And then I couldn't get the editor open to make these edits but, I SWEAR TO GOD I'M NOT REALLY STUPID.  I installed Arch on a Mac mini 2,1 so how stupid could I REALLY be?
